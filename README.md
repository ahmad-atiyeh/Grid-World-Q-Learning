# Grid World Q-Learning

This project is a grid-based environment simulation where an AI agent learns to navigate from a starting position to a goal while avoiding enemies. The environment consists of a 2D grid with a player, goal, and enemies placed randomly. The agent uses the Q-Learning reinforcement learning algorithm to learn the optimal policy for reaching the goal with maximum reward and minimal penalties.

## Features
- Customizable grid size and enemy placement
- Sliding moves option (agent can randomly move 2 steps)
- Q-Learning algorithm with epsilon-greedy policy
- Visualization of board and Q-table values
- Multiple training episodes for policy optimization

## How to Run
- Compile the code using a C++ compiler
- Run the executable and follow on-screen instructions
- Input grid settings and enemy positions as prompted

## Technologies
- C++ (Standard Library)
- Reinforcement Learning (Q-Learning Algorithm)
